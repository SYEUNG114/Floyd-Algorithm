# CSCK541 Software Development in Practice October 2022 A: Mid-Module Assignment

## Project Description
Rewrite Floyd’s algorithm to use recursion.  Write to PEP standards. Put under source control and write unit tests for each function. Write performance tests and check your version against the imperative version of the algorithm.

## Usage
Floyd’s algorithm in both recursive and imperative versions can be executed through floyd_recursive.py and floyd_imperative.py respectively.
test_case.py contains 6 test cases used in running Floyd’s algorithm.
Run unit test with unit_test.py
Run performance test with performance_test.py
